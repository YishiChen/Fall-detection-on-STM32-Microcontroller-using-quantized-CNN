# MlonMCU

This is a course project for the course Machine Learning on Microcontrollers at ETH Zürich.

The aim of this project is to develop a quantized and pruned CNN model for fall detection using real-time sensor data from a STM32 microcontroller.

The model was implemented and tested on the microcontroller itself.
